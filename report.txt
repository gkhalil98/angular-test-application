Steps:
1. I created four necessary files, the json file with test data, two models for my questions and answers, and a service to link these so they could display properly
2. In the json file I used the internet to find the correct syntax and then created my json file with questions about manchester united
3. For the models I created objects out of the questions and answers and then deserialized their information so I could work with the json data easier
4. Next I added my main functionality in the app.ts file
5. The final step was to create the html page and debug
6. When debugging I encountered a rather peculiar bug that I could not solve so I have included that screenshot, otherwise the logic is functional.
